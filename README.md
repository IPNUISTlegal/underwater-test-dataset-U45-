# underwater-test-dataset-U45-
This project contains an effective and pubic underwater test dataset (U45) including the color casts, low contrast and haze-like effects of underwater degradation. Besides, it includes the entire results and scores of Fusion Enhance (FE) [1], Retinex-Based (RB) [2], UDCP [3], UIBLA [4], RED [5], CycleGAN [6], Weakly Supervised Color Transfer (WSCT) [7] and our proposed method.

If you use the enhanced results and dataset, please cite the following papers:
