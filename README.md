# underwater-test-dataset-U45-
This project contains an effective and pubic underwater test dataset (U45) including the color casts, low contrast and haze-like effects of underwater degradation. Besides, it includes the entire results and scores of Fusion Enhance (FE) [1], Retinex-Based (RB) [2], UDCP [3], UIBLA [4], RED [5], CycleGAN [6], Weakly Supervised Color Transfer (WSCT) [7] and our proposed method.

If you use the enhanced results and dataset, please cite the following papers:

## 简单题目

### 0020.Valid Parentheses

使用栈,遍历输入字符串

如果当前字符为左半边括号时，则将其压入栈中

如果遇到右半边括号时，分类讨论：

1）如栈不为空且为对应的左半边括号，则取出栈顶元素，继续循环

2）若此时栈为空，则直接返回false

3）若不为对应的左半边括号，反之返回false
