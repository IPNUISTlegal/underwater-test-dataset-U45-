# underwater-test-dataset-U45-
This project contains an effective and pubic underwater test dataset (U45) including the color casts, low contrast and haze-like effects of underwater degradation. Besides, it includes the entire results and scores of Fusion Enhance (FE) [1], Retinex-Based (RB) [2], UDCP [3], UIBLA [4], RED [5], CycleGAN [6], Weakly Supervised Color Transfer (WSCT) [7] and our proposed method. This project contains high-resolution version paper (11.1MB) to maintain the comprehensiveness of the experiment and a better reading experience, which is exactly the same as arXiv preprint except the subjective comparisons on U45 dataset.

If you use the enhanced results and dataset, please cite the following papers:
